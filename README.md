## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
The novel coronavirus pandemic, also known as COVID-19, has undoubtedly and most unfortunately grown to be one of the worst global pandemic in recent history. As of April 7, 2020, there were more than 1.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world and more than 86,000 deaths, touching every continuent save Antarctica. Singapore has also been hit relatively hard by the virus.

Indeed, the threat of COVID-19 is very real and is only growing. The world has to comprehend this threat and it is by understanding the situation better that we may hopefully win the battle against the pandemic sooner rather than later. However, the need to understand how to tackle the virus is not necessarily exclusive to healthcare experts or servicemen. Everyone has to play their part in taking the right actions in order to help curb the spread of the virus. It may be as simple as sanitising your hands frequently, to keeping up to date with the latest news on a country’s preventive measures. If any one individual fails to understand and carry out the right actions, the risk of spreading the virus is compounded and if one individual becomes many, said risk will no doubt grow exponentially. 

Our project team is dedicated in equipping the general public with the relevant knowledge they should know in order to best protect themselves and those around them against the spread of the virus. As such, we have come up with a solution to help disseminate information on COVID-19 as simply and conveniently as possible. In fact, we have taken the term ‘knowledge’ quite literally by introducing artificial intelligence aided systems in our solution.

First and foremost, our solution will take advantage of the cognitive system capabilities found in a chatbot. We will be making use of the natural language processing provided by Google’s Diaglogflow service and deploying it on Telegram, one of the most popular and widely used messaging platforms. These will help us to reach out to a vast majority of the general public. Secondly, we apply machine reasoning to acquire and prepare our knowledge base of information related to COVID-19. Further to that, we have made use of machine inference in the form of rules so that users can ask questions and be provided with the relevant answers and knowledge that they need. Last but certainly not least, our solution is also a reasoning system as we understand that each user’s needs are unique. As such, we are able to search for answers that best suit the user’s specific needs, such as providing the user with an optimal answer relative to his/her location. 

Our project team hopes that with our solution, the general public will be able to receive updated knowledge through a method that is easy to use, accessible, understandable and personalised. It is only through the efforts of every single individual in doing their part in fighting COVID-19 that we may stop this pandemic. If our solution could play a small role in doing that, then it would already be a humble success in our books.
